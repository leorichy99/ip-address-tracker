## Overview

IP Address Tracker is a responsive web application that allows users to search for any IP address or domain and view its geolocation information on an interactive map. The project is built with React, LeafletJS for mapping, and the IP Geolocation API by IPify for location data.

This project was developed as part of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenge. It demonstrates modern React development practices, API integration, responsive design, and interactive UI components.

## Features

- **Automatic Geolocation:** On initial load, the app displays your current IP address and its location on the map.
- **Search Functionality:** Enter any valid IPv4, IPv6 address, or domain to view its location and key details.
- **Interactive Map:** Uses LeafletJS for a smooth, interactive map experience. Zoom controls adapt to mobile and desktop layouts.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Error Handling:** Displays clear error messages for invalid input or failed lookups.
- **Loading States:** Modern loading spinner UI for a polished user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (with hooks)
- **LeafletJS** (react-leaflet)
- **Ant Design** (for loading and error UI)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling)
- **IPify Geolocation API** (for IP/domain location data)
